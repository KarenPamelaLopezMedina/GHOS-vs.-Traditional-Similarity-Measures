# GHOS-vs.-Traditional-Similarity-Measures
This repository includes the code and data sets of the experiments related to the paper GHOS vs. Traditional Similarity Measures: A Comprehensive Study of Data Stream Classification Efficiency submitted to The 2nd International Conference on Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition

Three data sets were used. 
1. KDD Cup 1999: 10% of the total corpus was used and the top 10 classes were selected. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karenp/kdd-cup-1999-10majority-classes
3. Cover Type. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karenp/cover-type-reordered
4. Statlog (Shuttle) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karenp/statlog-shuttle-reordered

The training is done with 2000 instances ensuring that all classes are presented in these instances.

And finally the notebook where the experiments were carried out with the data sets described above and the similarity metrics: GHOS, Jaccard index, Minkowsky 1, Minokowsky 2, Manhattan and Pearson coefficient.
